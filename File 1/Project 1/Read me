Red Wine Quality Prediction Project
Project Description
The dataset is related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Due to privacy and logistic issues, 
only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, 
wine brands, wine selling prices, etc.).

This dataset can be viewed as a classification task. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are many more 
normal wines than excellent or poor ones). Also, we are not sure if all input variables are relevant. So it could be 
interesting to test feature selection methods.


Medical Cost Personal Insurance Project

Project Description

Health insurance is a type of insurance that covers medical expenses that arise due to an illness. These expenses could be 
related to hospitalization costs, cost of medicines, or doctor consultation fees. The main purpose of medical insurance is 
to receive the best medical care without any strain on your finances. Health insurance plans offer protection against high 
medical costs. It covers hospitalization expenses, daycare procedures, domiciliary expenses, and ambulance charges, 
among many others. Based on certain input features such as age, BMI, no of dependents, smoker, and region  medical 
insurance is calculated.
